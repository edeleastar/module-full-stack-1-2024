# Connecting Studio3T to Cloud Atlas

Before connecting our application to the Cloud Atlas database, we will first connect Studio 3T.  This will help verify that all is configured correctly.

Open Studio 3T :

... and create a new connection (click on **'Create'**)

Paste your connection string form the last step:

```
mongodb+srv://playtime:YOURDBPASSWORDHERE@cluster0-qEZZQQTTDDWw.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Make sure you have the correct password in the string (capitalise above) and paste into the URI field. Studio 3T will validate the connection string.

You should then be able to press 'Connect':

If test reports no errors, you should be able to browse the Atlas hosted database now.
