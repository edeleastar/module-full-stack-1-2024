# npm Modules

Our uuidv4() function works fine:

~~~javascript
  function uuidv4() {
    return "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx".replace(/[xy]/g, function (c) {
      var r = Math.random() * 16 | 0, v = c == "x" ? r : (r & 0x3 | 0x8);
      return v.toString(16);
    });
  }
~~~

However, this function - and a set of related functions if we need them, as available as a library:

- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid>

You as used to using npm modules within node applications. However, Front End frameworks can not also used this ecosystem, with the various bundling/packaging tools combining the modules for client side development.

Start by install the module in the usual way:

~~~bash
npm install uuid
~~~

This extends our package.json with a new entry (at the end):

~~~json
{
  "name": "todo-svelte",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte": "^1.0.0-next.30",
    "svelte": "^3.44.0",
    "vite": "^2.8.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "uuid": "^8.3.2"
  }
}
~~~

We can now replace the function by importing the library version:

```javascript
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

Verify that this works as before.
